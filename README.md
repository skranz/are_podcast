# NotebookLM Reviews of Economics

AI generated audio deep dives for open access articles from the [Annual Review of Economics](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/economics). The deep dives were generated with Google's [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/).

The MP3 are stored as releases and form the basis for podcast specified in `podcast_feed.xml`.
